    "This is a program created to simulate a grade calculator, so that students can enter their grade as an integer and see what their letter grade is. Depending on the grade, the program also returns some advice based on the user's academic situation. To do this I used the scanner class and multiple if-else if-else statements to assign a value for the different cases. In the code you can see how the variables are called in different parts of the program. In the first part of the program, I created a Scanner object to take the user's input as an integer. The different if statements determine the value assigned to the value variable. A 90 or above (A) is assigned value = 1, and so on. There is also the default value of 0, which is used to handle improper input. After, the value variable is called as a parameter for the switch cases, which print the output based on the grade. "
