    "For and while are fairly similar because they both use several integer values to iterate through a loop to reach a certain number of repeats. The primary difference is that one uses the \"x\" integer (which is modified by adding to one for each loop) inside the loop, and the other instantiates it outside of the loop. However, recursion takes three basic integers as parameters because it depends on the initialized values to loop. Moreover, the function is called as part of a loop. The recursive function also relies on reducing the counter variable until it matches 0, because trying to count up leads to an infinite loop."
