    "- Inheritance is used to store attributes for subclasses, making abstraction easier and reducing risk of error\n",
    "- Subclass constructor has to include \"super\" to access superclass parameters\n",
    "- Use @Override to override a method\n",
    "- One useful superclass is Object from java.lang\n",
    "- Polymorphism is when a method is used for different tasks in different classes (different forms)"
